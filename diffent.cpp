// What is the difference between OOP and POP?
/*
They both have different work approaches.
On the one hand, the OOP style of programming divides a program info objects,
whereas POP divides it info function. As there's no direct approach for a particular
problem, a programmer uses programming languages.

POP :- Conventional Programming, using high level language such as COBOL.
